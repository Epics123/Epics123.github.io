            <h5>10/27/2021</h5>
            <div class="h-30"></div>

            <p>
                About three weeks have passed since my team has chosen which game concept we want to work on for the rest of the semester, and we finally have a name for the game: <i><b>Mapstermind</b>!</i> Mapstermind is a fast-paced 3v1 party game where
                a 3-player team must collaborate to escape a game board-like room before the timer reaches zero. These players (dubbed "The Little Guys") must complete a multitude of tasks to work towards unlocking the room's main door. The fourth player,
                 a floating pair of hands called "The Mapster" places traps, pulls levers, and presses buttons to trap, fling, and annoy the other three players. The sole objective of The Mapster is to waste as much of the other player's time as possible.
            </p>

            <p>
                Mapstermind should encourage teamwork among the Little Guys while creating intense yet lighthearted competition between them and the Mapster. In order to achieve this, we need to strike a good balance between the Little Guys and the Mapster.
                If either side is too powerful, we lose that competitive feeling that we want our game to have. We also want our game to be lighthearted and friendly fun, and making a deliberate choice to have cute art style and characters will help sell that
                feeling even more. Most couch co-op party games are straight forward and easy to understand, and we have been iterating constantly on visual feedback and objective clarity so that we can make the experience as smooth as possible for the players. 
            </p>

            <br>

            <h3 class="uppercase">Choosing a Game Idea</h3>
            <h5>10/5/2021</h5>
            <div class="h-30"></div>
            <p>
                It has been a few weeks since starting the pre-production process, and my team has narrowed down the project that we would like to pursue for the rest of the semester. We have decided to go with a 3 vs 1 couch co-op party game, though the 
                specific interactions between the group of 3 players and the single player is still being worked out. The team really liked the idea of letting the lone player mess with the environment in some way to thwart what the other players were doing.
                There is a lot of potential to create fun and unique mechanics from this. We have already started experimenting with different win/loss states like having a time limit versus more of a battle scenario where both teams of players are trying to
                reduce each other's heath to zero. We've also been playing with the idea of having the lone player being able to place various traps and obstacles around the map to hinder the rest of the players.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are not many other couch co-op party games around that have a 3v1 competition as their core focus, and even less that give the solo player the ability to thwart everyone else though environmental manipulation. Our idea provides a unique 
                experience for players to enjoy, with a large potential for interesting interactions between the teams of players. We want our game to be something that you invite your friends over to play on the weekend, and have a blast taking turns messing
                with each other. Those who enjoy fast-paced and teamwork based gameplay will enjoy our game, along with those who like to use a bit of strategy while playing. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Our first round of QA testing was very positive, which reinforced for us that we have a solid idea that is worth pursuing. My team is incredibly excited about this idea, and are looking forward to iterating further on what we have.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h3 class="uppercase">Making Compromises</h3>
            <h5>9/15/2021</h5>
            <div class="h-30"></div>
            <p>The past three years here at Champlain College have taught me that managing the scope of your game with the time that you have is an extremely important skill to have. It is important, especially in small scale teams, to be aware
                and realistic about what your team will be able to accomplish. There are times when you have to make a descision on what can and can't stay in the game base on the the time and resources you have. Unfortunately, this is easier said than done. 
            </p>

            <p>
                During our initial brainstorming process, my team explored a bunch of different genres and ideas that we could potentially pursue. The first thing we did was decide on whether or not our game should have networked multiplayer. At this stage, 
                I am the only programmer on the team with any networking experience, and I was aware of the complexity that creating a networked game would add to the project. The team was interested in exploring that option, so I informed them of what it would 
                require to make a networked game, and we decided that our time and resources would be better spent elsewhere. Our goal was to have a polished prototype that could move on to the spring semester, and we feared that spending too much time on networking
                would hinder the development of our game.
            </p>

            <p>
                The team as a whole still wanted to have a cooperative experience of some sort, so we decided to add local multiplayer games to our list of potential games to pursue. During our brainstorming we 
                would discuss a particular style of game or mechanic, and weigh it against how feasible it is to develop that idea with the time that we have. I would always try to not get swept away at the coolness or "wow factor" of an idea, and instead
                think of how we could go about implementing what we were talking about. Thinking this way really helped me to stay grounded while brainstorming, and kept me focused on staying in scope with the time that we had.
            </p>
